# Knowledge Base Angular Demo

This repo is from a course on building multiple pages in Angular.  Here I was
able to start from scratch using NodeJS and Express to setup our backend side of
things using a MongoDB.  This allowed me to have a simple json object to use
when creating the Angular front end side of things.
