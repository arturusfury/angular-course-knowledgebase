# Knowledge Base Angular Demo

This repo is from a course on building multiple pages in Angular.  Here I was
able to start from scratch using NodeJS and Express to setup our backend side of
things using a MongoDB.  This allowed me to have a simple json object to use
when creating the Angular front end side of things.

With full CRUD functionallity with Angular we can now use this as a good base
for any sort of content management system like a Blog, or Wiki or anything that
contains a mass entry of information.  While they categories don't have the
ability for full CRUD even when some of the functions were added in, they are
not any different then our existing articles and won't take much to get them in
there.
